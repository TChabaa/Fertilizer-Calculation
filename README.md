The efficient and effective use of fertilizers is becoming increasingly important in rice
cultivation due to the rising global demand for food and the reduction of fertile
agricultural land. This study aims to develop a fertilizer optimization model using the
Fuzzy Mamdani method. This method was chosen for its ability to handle the
uncertainties and complexities often found in agricultural systems, as well as its
flexibility in decision-making based on various soil and plant parameters. By considering
factors such as organic carbon content, total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, soil pH,
and cation exchange capacity, the Fuzzy Mamdani method can provide more
comprehensive and targeted recommendations. The implementation of this method is
expected to enhance fertilizer efficiency, increase crop productivity, maintain soil
fertility, and reduce negative environmental impacts. The findings of the study indicate
that the Fuzzy Mamdani method is not only easy to implement but also adaptable to
changing field conditions, making it an effective and sustainable tool for fertilizer
management in rice farming.
